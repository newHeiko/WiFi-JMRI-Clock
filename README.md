# WiFi-JMRI-Clock
Wireless clock client to receive data from JMRI JSON server.

Battery-powered WiFi interface for cheap analog wall clocks to get their time from a JMRI json server - hardware in hardware/wfred_loconet_clock.*

It is built around ESP12E/ESP12F WiFi modules, powered by 2xAA cells and supposed to fit a Strapubox 6090 housing (Fredi form factor, but includes a battery compartment).

The contents of this repo has been generated from my wiFred-repo which was supposed to contain three different projects - but that turned out to be unworkable.

The ESP source code consists of an Arduino sketch, configurable by a web interface (WIP).

In-Progress-Version of documentation available in documentation/ subfolder.

I have ordered PCBs around Christmas 2017 and hope to have a proof of concept plus more/better organized docs by summer (2018).

Also have a look at the pictures in this directory, they show 3D-renderings of the PCBs in early stages.

Please be patient with me if you have any questions, this is my first GitHub repo and I'm not a developer by trade, so I will make a lot of stupid mistakes ;)
